Hi Stefan,

Couldn't figure out another way of contacting you (no e-mail address in your github profile,
there's an info@ address in your whois record which didn't work), hence this:

Your branch is very impressive work, and it looks like you've done a bunch of things that
were on our informal roadmap.

Have you given any thought to getting this merged into the code we release from? I haven't
looked in depth yet, but I expect your changes are a mix of bug and UI changes, and I'd like
to figure out a good way to get the bug fixes in, and see what ordering makes sense for the
UI changes (maybe it's a big-bang style "And now Squeezer is Material", or maybe some of
the changes should come in as incremental improvements -- I'm not sure).

Best, Nik (nik@ngo.org.uk)
